Browser games for my kids

## Tic Tac Toe
A quick implementation of Tic Tac Toe, where the kid can choose the color they want to be, and the computer won't win or stalemate every time.
### TODO: 
* Let kid draw lines instead of auto-drawing the winning line. Just display a flag saying somebody won.
* Stop computer from playing once a winner is found
* Add a little logic to the computer player (kid is catching on that the computer is guessing randomly)

### Dependencies:
* https://github.com/tovic/color-picker/blob/master/color-picker.min.css
* https://github.com/tovic/color-picker/blob/master/color-picker.min.js
